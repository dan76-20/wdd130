    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose increase bookings for rafting excursions on the rivers. 
        We can do this by showing the types of experiences they may
        have while on a rafting excursion. We can also increase bookings by
        showing how much more active a participant they may be during
        a rafting trip unlike in other activities such as fishing. We can drive
        revenue and bookings by offering group rates and differing lengths of
        trips.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our customers are people who want to explore the outdoors but may not
        have the equipment or know how to do it on their own. Many of our 
        customers will be in their early to mid 30's who have established a 
        family and a career. They will be people who don't have as much time 
        as they would like to spend outdoors with their family as they would 
        like and would like to get away from all distractions to spend quality
        time with each other.They are people who may need a guide to help them 
        navigate the river and to make sure that they will have everything that 
        they need in order to make the trip a success. Our guides will have 
        expert knowledge in the areas of the river being traveled and will 
        be able to assure all members of the group that they are safe at 
        all times. Our target audience are those who want to experience 
        river rafting with their friends and families while leaving the 
        hard work to those who know the area. Many of our target audience will 
        access our site through a desktop PC at work while they dream of getting 
        away from work and all of lifes distractions.
