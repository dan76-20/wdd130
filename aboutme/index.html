    <h2>Daniel Marks</h2>
    <p>Hello all, nice to meet you. My name is Daniel but please just
        call me Dan. I'm an Applied Technology student who is focusing on
        Web Development and Database. This will be my second bachelors degree
        with my first having been obtained in my youth in Business Management.
        I would love to be a backend web developer and am very excited to
        get things underway.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am 46 and live in Idaho in the United States, never married and
        actually stopped looking to even date almost 20 years ago. Just never
        put it high on my list of priorities I guess. As such I have a lot
        of free time on my hands with no family to care for. Due to this I spend
        a lot of time reading books and gaming.
    </p>

        I have loved gaming since I picked up my first Nintendo controller
        and played my first RPG named Dragon Warrior(Now renamed Dragon Quest).
        Now days I play many types of games but spend a lot of time playing
        MMORPG's such as Everquest and Final Fantasy 14. You might even catch
        me streaming my gameplay on Twitch early mornings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, I am very excited to work with all of you and am looking
        forward to learning from all of you. I don't have a whole lot of 
        experience programming as my local High School didn't even have
        a PC until my Junior year in 1993, but I put in the work and normally
        do well when I apply myself.
