                If you would like to come in and check the Golden Games Center 
                out and meet some of the employees and other members, just provide 
                us with your name, phone number and a time you would like to come in 
                to visit the center and we would be happy to show you around. You 
                will be able to see the gaming centers, the wonderful cafeteria, 
                and the library full of comfortable seats and plenty of books to 
                read. Those ready to sign up we do ask a $10 per month donation in 
                order to help keep the Center up and running and in good condition. 
                Most of our expenses come in the form of donations from multiple 
                technology and software companies, Microsoft, Sony, EA, and Blizzard, 
                just to name a few. We understand that for some the $10 is not possible 
                as they are on a very tight budget, and that is why it is not a fee. 
                If it is not doable, we understand and you are more than welcome to 
                join us anyhow.
