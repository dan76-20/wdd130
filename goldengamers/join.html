<!-- I created a contact form. It was nice as I had planned on creating one already for my personal site (see the
    wireframe for the join page) and this really helped. I did have to figure out how to get the javascript to work
    with it though, but that was a lot of fun.-->

                        If you would like to come in and check the Golden Games Center
                        out and meet some of the employees and other members, just provide
                        us with your name, phone number and a time you would like to come in
                        to visit the center and we would be happy to show you around. You
                        will be able to see the gaming centers, the wonderful cafeteria,
                        and the library full of comfortable seats and plenty of books to
                        read. Those ready to sign up we do ask a $10 per month donation in
                        order to help keep the Center up and running and in good condition.
                        Most of our expenses come in the form of donations from multiple
                        technology and software companies, Microsoft, Sony, EA, and Blizzard,
                        just to name a few. We understand that for some the $10 is not possible
                        as they are on a very tight budget, and that is why it is not a fee.
                        If it is not doable, we understand and you are more than welcome to
                        join us anyhow.
