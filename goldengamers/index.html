                    Welcome Gamers! Did you know that over a quarter of all video game players
                    are over the age of 45? Amazing isn’t it? To many people think of games as
                    being for children, well those people are wrong. Gaming knows no age. A
                    game doesn’t care how old you are. A game doesn’t care how much time you
                    have to play. Games are there for anyone that wants to pick up a controller
                    or put their hands on a keyboard and mouse. Games are many things. They are
                    thought provoking, head scratching puzzles, a means of telling a wonderful
                    story, or portals to another world! Imagine yourself as a Barbarian warrior
                    fighting your way through hoards of enemies to slay that dragon. Or maybe
                    you see yourself as a detective trying to solve a crime by examining the
                    many clues that you find surrounding yourself. With video games, there
                    is no limit other than your imagination. Don’t let your fears of technology
                    stand in your way, come and join us. Find that new world and make new
                    friends. So many worlds need you. Hero, adventure awaits. Click the button
