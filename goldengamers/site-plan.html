    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I am an avid video gamer and the son of aging parents. People that
      grew up playing video games are now starting to reach their senior
      years and retirement has left many without the daily mental stimulation
      and socialization that every person needs. Many studies have shown the
      benefits of Seniors playing video games yet many do not have the money to
      spend on them or the knowledge of how to get started. It seems like a
      Senior center outfitted with gaming equipment would solve these issues.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience is the Senior community and their families.
      We want to show them that games are not just for their grandchildren but
      are for them as well. Overcoming a lack of convidence and breaking down
      barriers is one of our major goals in this website. We want all seniors
      to understand there is stigma other than that in their own mind that
      will prevent them from playing and enjoying themselves. Once we
      overcome the stigma and lack of confidence we can show them how much
      fun it can be in order to get together with other like minded seniors
      and game together. A small monthly membership fee would be used to
      keep technology up to date and in functional state so that they don't
      even have to worry about the upfront costs and setup that would be required to
      have the same technology in their own home. Our staff and volunteers would always
      be on hand in order to help them with any questions or assistance they need.</p> <!-- change this -->

      Welcome Gamers!
      Did you know that over a quarter of all video game players are over the age of 45? Amazing isn’t it? To many
      people think of games as being for children, well those people are wrong. Gaming knows no age. A game doesn’t care
      how old you are. A game doesn’t care how much time you have to play. Games are there for anyone that wants to pick
      up a controller or put their hands on a keyboard and mouse.
      Games are many things. They are thought provoking, head scratching puzzles, a means of telling a wonderful story,
      or portals to another world! Imagine yourself as a Barbarian warrior fighting your way through hoards of enemies
      to slay that dragon. Or maybe you see yourself as a detective trying to solve a crime by examining the many clues
      that you find surrounding yourself. With video games, there is no limit other than your imagination.
      Don’t let your fears of technology stand in your way, come and join us. Find that new world and make new friends.
      So many worlds need you. Hero, adventure awaits. Click the button below and join us on this adventure.

    <h3>The Benefits</h3>
    <p>
      As people age and approach retirement they often start to lack the mental 
      stimulation that they had experienced their entire working career. Instead,
       they find themselves, especially in the winter months, spending more and 
       more time in front of the television. Some television is not so bad but 
       to much of the wrong kinds of television can cause a lack of mental 
       stimulation. In order to keep your mind sharp you need to keep it active. 
       Some work puzzles, crosswords or card games. This is great, but there is 
       an entire world of interactive entertainment that is constantly changing. 
       By having new problems to work out and new exciting visual experiences our 
       members are able to keep their minds sharp. They don’t have to worry about 
       reworking the same puzzles when they run out of puzzles. We offer a 
       library of video games that they can play solo or in a social setting.
        We encourage our members to experience many types of games and to 
        experience the electronic worlds around them.

What we offer here at the Golden Gamers Center is a judgment free environment for our gamers. We know that some people have not played modern games before and might be a little hesitant. Some get easily frustrated with technology and give up when they cannot get it to work. Here at Golden Gamers have people on staff at all times that are willing to sit down and help you as you learn the technology so that you feel comfortable at all times. No one should give up gaming due to frustration with the technology. As such we can sit with you any time and help explain the technology or the game with you as you play. And for those more tech savvy we can be as hands off as you wish.

    <h3>Join Us</h3>
    <p>
      If you would like to come in and check the Golden Games Center out and 
      meet some of the employees and other members, just provide us with your 
      name, phone number and a time you would like to come in to visit the 
      center and we would be happy to show you around. You will be able to 
      see the gaming centers, the wonderful cafeteria, and the library full 
      of comfortable seats and plenty of books to read.

Those ready to sign up we do ask a $10 per month donation in order to help keep the Center up and running and in good condition. Most of our expenses come in the form of donations from multiple technology and software companies, Microsoft, Sony, EA, and Blizzard, just to name a few. We understand that for some the $10 is not possible as they are on a very tight budget, and that is why it is not a fee. If it is not doable, we understand and you are more than welcome to join us anyhow.
