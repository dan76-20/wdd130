      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am an avid video gamer and the son of aging parents. People that 
        grew up playing video games are now starting to reach their senior 
        years and retirement has left many without the daily mental stimulation 
        and socialization that every person needs. Many studies have shown the 
        benefits of Seniors playing video games yet many do not have the money to 
        spend on them or the knowledge of how to get started. It seems like a 
        Senior center outfitted with gaming equipment would solve these issues.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience is the Senior community and their families.
         We want to show them that games are not just for their grandchildren but 
         are for them as well. Overcoming a lack of convidence and breaking down 
         barriers is one of our major goals in this website. We want all seniors 
         to understand there is stigma other than that in their own mind that 
         will prevent them from playing and enjoying themselves. Once we 
         overcome the stigma and lack of confidence we can show them how much 
         fun it can be in order to get together with other like minded seniors 
         and game together. A small monthly membership fee would be used to
         keep technology up to date and in functional state so that they don't 
         even have to worry about the upfront costs and setup that would be required to 
         have the same technology in their own home. Our staff and volunteers would always
         be on hand in order to help them with any questions or assistance they need.</p>  <!-- change this -->
