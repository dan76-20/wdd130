                    As people age and approach retirement they often start to lack the
                    mental stimulation that they had experienced their entire working career.
                    Instead, they find themselves, especially in the winter months, spending
                    more and more time in front of the television. Some television is not so
                    bad but to much of the wrong kinds of television can cause a lack of
                    mental stimulation. In order to keep your mind sharp you need to keep
                    it active. Some work puzzles, crosswords or card games. This is great,
                    but there is an entire world of interactive entertainment that is
                    constantly changing. By having new problems to work out and new exciting
                    visual experiences our members are able to keep their minds sharp.
                    They donâ€™t have to worry about reworking the same puzzles when they
                    run out of puzzles. We offer a library of video games that they can
                    play solo or in a social setting. We encourage our members to
                    experience many types of games and to experience the electronic
                    worlds around them. What we offer here at the Golden Gamers Center
                    is a judgment free environment for our gamers. We know that some people
                    have not played modern games before and might be a little hesitant. Some
                    get easily frustrated with technology and give up when they cannot get
                    it to work. Here at Golden Gamers have people on staff at all times that
                    are willing to sit down and help you as you learn the technology so that
                    you feel comfortable at all times. No one should give up gaming due to
                    frustration with the technology. As such we can sit with you any time
                    and help explain the technology or the game with you as you play. And
                    for those more tech savvy we can be as hands off as you wish.

                    Our cafeteria offers a wide variety of delicious, healthy food options.
                    We have food to fit the dietary needs of all our members. Everything
                    from a nutritious club and chef salads, to a good old fashion sandwich.
                    We can accommodate almost any dietary need that you might have. Our
                    lunches have a cost per meal, but that cost is nothing more than the cost
                    of the items, no profit made on the food. If you qualify for a food subsidy
                    such as meals on wheels, just let us know. We are an approved provider
                    of meals on wheels and can provide you the meals you need each day.
